Modularity is currently the target metric for GNN training.

## Output

Examining the clusters (produced via a basic, unrefined KMeans), we get evidence of repulsion & attraction working effectively. If we compare this to the composite graph, we can see the repulsive effects more clearly. See output/logs for more metrics.
